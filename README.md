# gmail-stats
Google Apps Script to more easily visualize number of emails from senders.

## Deploy for personal use
1. Go to https://script.google.com/home and create a new project.
2. Add the `Gmail` service to your project. 
3. Copy in the source here.
4. Click Deploy in the top right. Deploy as a Web App project. Make it accessible only to you. Thanks Google for handling auth.
5. Go to the link and wait a while for all your data to load; it took me a couple minutes of waiting to process and view 3000~ emails.
